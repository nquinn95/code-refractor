code refractor homework for UCF bootcamp

Nick Quinn code refractor homework
Mostly focused on cleaning up the CSS and using semantic code in the html file.  
Consolidated a lot of the CSS so that classes that had the same function did not have redundant code.
Changed CSS classes to semantic code names, i.e. aside and styled those instead of having unique classes
HTML replaced div with semantic code and fixed button links.
Added a website title with my name and the homework name.
Added accessibility feature that was required in the assignment.
